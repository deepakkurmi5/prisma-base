  Warnings:

  - The primary key for the `Category` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `Category` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `Post` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `Post` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The `authorId` column on the `Post` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `Profile` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `Profile` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `_CategoryToPost` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The primary key for the `users` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - You are about to drop the column `name` on the `users` table. All the data in the column will be lost.
  - The `id` column on the `users` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - Changed the type of `userId` on the `Profile` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Changed the type of `A` on the `_CategoryToPost` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Changed the type of `B` on the `_CategoryToPost` table. No cast exists, the column would be dropped and recreated, which cannot be done if there is data, since the column is required.
  - Added the required column `firstName` to the `users` table without a default value. This is not possible if the table is not empty.
